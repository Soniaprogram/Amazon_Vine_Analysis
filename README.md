# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Using my knowledge of PySpark, I determined if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as a part of the Vine program. For this analysis, I determined if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
