Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews

Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews

Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (README.md)

## Overview of the analysis

I have been tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their producs. Using my knowledge of PySpark, I determined if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as a part of the Vine program. For this analysis, I determined if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 94 Vine reviews (paid). There were 40,471 non-Vine reviews (unpaid).

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 48 Vine 5-star reviews (paid). There were 15,663 non-Vine 5-star reviews (unpaid). 

* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?


## Summary
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
